# Python Tutorial Series

I have started my python journey with the Udemy course [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python Programming](https://www.udemy.com/course/automate/) by Al Sweigart. 

Even since, I wanted to note down what I learnt in my own ways to make it easier to understand although Al does a pretty good job in making it easy. 

I will also ocassionally add snippets and lessons outside of the course that I learnt from various sources and update parts of the original course since it's pretty old.

## Python3 and IDE Installation

I will not go into the details of python3 and IDE installation because it's pretty simple however you can go [here](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) and follow the steps to set up your IDE.
To give an overview of what an IDE is, it's an Integrated Development Environment. But what does that junky word even mean? Well, in simple terms it's just like a notepad to write your code in but it comes with the in-built tools and a terminal to easily run your code without the extra steps.

You can write you code in a code editor, notepad or even carve them in cave walls and then execute them though the shell. But IDE's like VSCode or Pycharm etc makes it much easier and cleaner with the built in tools and extensions they provide.
